Always wanted to have a battle for Siget in your VSCode window?
Now you can have one with a simple extension.

## Thanks

This extension was forked from the original work by [tonybaloney](https://github.com/tonybaloney).

Without his project, my inspiration and this extension would never happen.

I encourage you to support him and download his extension on [VS Code marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tonybaloney.vscode-pets&WT.mc_id=python-17801-anthonyshaw).

I am also grateful to other developers & designers who helped creating the original extension.

## Using Bitka za Siget

After installing, open the command palette with `Ctrl+Shift+P` on Windows/Linux or `Cmd(⌘)+Shift+P` on MacOS.  

Run the "Start battle for Siget" command (`vscode-bitka-za-siget.start`) to see Nikola Šubić Zrinjski in your VSCode window.

## Thank you
